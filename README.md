### Downloadable on [my website!](https://vodrix.neocities.org/downloads)

### Improvements or changes:

* Automatically compacting after deleting and adding files
* Sizes are now displayed in KB, MB, and GB in listviews, fileviews are still displayed in bytes
* Listviews are now grids
* Shortcuts are now handled in Listviews
* Drive letters replaced by a Browse entry in listviews
* Archives now contain an entry to go back, instead of being forced to use backspace
* Better ergonomics (better hotkeys, better right-click menu)
* Accurate names for filetypes
* Ability to change directories at will, no longer required to verify game contents or be written in the registry.
* Working scrolling (up down, and left right) in fileview
* TS/RA2 maps display map thumbnail and ini code
* Different font in fileview, text is no longer right next to boundary
* Hopefully shouldn't occasionally make the wrong type of mix file upon creation
* Ability to pause audio file by "opening" the same file twice
* Changed it so only one audio file can play at once, will replace currently playing track with a new one upon playing
* Ability to copy mix files as text files (copies the fileview text)
* Ability to copy palette files as text files (18bit values and hexadecimal)
* Fixed so many typos you wouldn't believe (palette is finally spelt right)
* .fnt previews in fileview now will always be able to display each character without overlapping
* Will not try to draw map thumbnails that are too small to feasibly be uncorrupted
* Improved auto-palette logic (still far from perfect)
* Better support for dune 2 shape files (and overall?)
* No longer crashes on attempting to open mix files with corrupted headers (will be without proper filenames)
* Better filetype detection (maps aren't text files, and neither are ini files)
* Merged code from Tomsons' and Omniblades forks (Their work should improve overall accuracy and stability)
* Global Mix Database cleaned up

### TODO:
* More ergonomic changes, such as hotkey changing and dark mode
* Support for back and forward mouse keys
* Better voxel rendering
* Whatever is possible to make this program as good as possible
